(*
  Worker implementation
  ---------------------
  the worker runs a server which accept connection on the given port
  (see function "compute" below)

  on each accepted connection, it does a double-fork and the grand-child
  runs function "server_fun" with the computation function "compute"
  and the socket ("cin", "cout") as arguments;
  we call this ``the worker'' from now on

  the worker has a main loop waiting for messages from the master
  (using "select" on the socket); each message is managed using
  "handle_message_from_master". Messages Kill, Ping and Stop are handled
  immediately.

  An Assign message makes the worker fork a sub-process, say P, which runs the
  computation using "compute". The worker and P communicate using a pipe.

  When the computation is completed, its result is written to the pipe and P
  terminates.

  The worker, on the other side, checks whether there is something to read
  from the pipe (with the same call to "select" it is using to read from the
  master). It so, it reads it and send a Completed message to the master.

  BEWARE: the worker cannot simply wait for P to complete using
  waitpid [WNOHANG] pid and then read from the pipe, since for P to complete
  it must be necessary to read from the pipe; said otherwise, we could have
  a deadlock with the worker waiting for P to complete before reading from
  the pipe, and P waiting for the worker to read from the pipe in order to
  complete (its writing to the pipe)

  ANOTHER CAVEAT: one could have the worker handle several computations in
  parallel (corresponding to the number of cores to use on that machine).
  But then we could have a deadlock between the master and the worker, with
  the master trying to send a large Assign message, waiting for the worker to
  read it, while the worker tries to send a large Completed message, waiting
  for the master to read it.
  We avoid this caveat by having the worker performing only one computation at
  a time, and having several instances of that worker, one for each ``core''.

(** Master *****************************************************************)

(*
  Master implementation

  Each available worker is represented as a record of type "worker" below.
  Each worker is given a distinct ID, stored in field "worker_id".
  The field "sockaddr" stores the connection socket, to be used to (re)connect.
  Fields "fdin" and "fdout" are only meaningful for a connected worker, and
  contain the socket to communicate with the worker.
  The field "job" contains either None, for an idle worker, or Some j for a
  worker currently perfoming the task with ID j (tasks have IDs, distinct
  from worker IDs).

  New workers are declared with function "declare_workers" and stored
  in the global list "workers".

  The master loop is implemented in function "main_master".
  It maintains a queue of tasks to do (todo) and a set of idle workers
  (idle_workers). It loops as long as there is some task to do or
  some task currently running, with the following 3 steps.

  The first step is to check and update the status of each worker,
  which could be:
  - Disconnected: we try to connect and, if so, declare the worker idle
  - Pinged: we look for a possible timeout and, if so, remove from idle workers
    and reschedule its task, if any
  - Ok/Error: we send ping, if appropriate

  The second step is to start new tasks, if possible: if there is some idle
  worker and some task to do, we try to assign the latter to the former
  (with "create_job"). On failure, we backtrack and put the task back into the
  todo queue.

  The last step consists in listening to workers, using "select".
  For each worker returned by select, we call "listen_for_worker", which
  does the following. First, it set the status to Ok, since we just received
  a message. Then it handles the message, which can be:
  - Pong: if idle, the worker is put back in the idle worker set
          (most likely it was already in that set)
  - Completed: we make the worker idle (with "make_idle") and update the task
               status; in particular we kill all other jobs for that task, if
               any (it could have been rescheduled)
  - Aborted: we make the worker idle and put the task back into the todo queue
